git commit -m "feat: add menu-driven interface and system flow

I implement the complete system flow for the Car Rental System by creating a menu-driven console interface that guides users through all major operations, including customer management, car management, rental processing, and report generation. The main menu presents clear options and continuously loops until the user chooses to exit. The customer flow allows registration, viewing, updating, and searching by ID, while the car flow handles vehicle inventory with availability tracking. The rental process enables booking cars with automatic fee calculation and status updates, and the return flow finalizes transactions while updating records. All user actions communicate with service layers that manage collections, ensuring modularity and maintainability. This commit finalizes a fully functional, structured, and user-friendly system flow for the Car Rental System."
